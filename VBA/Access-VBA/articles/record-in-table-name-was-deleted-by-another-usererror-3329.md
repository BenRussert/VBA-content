# Record in table <name> was deleted by another user. (Error 3329)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The row that you are trying to edit has been deleted by another user. This behavior can be prevented by having all users in the database use pessimistic locking.
