 **Remarks**
A  **Label** control on a form displays descriptive text such as titles, captions, pictures, or brief instructions.

A **Label** doesn't display values from[data sources](glossary-vba.md) or expressions; it is always[unbound](glossary-vba.md) and doesn't change as you move from record to record.
The default property for a  **Label** is the **Caption** property.
The default event for a  **Label** is the Click event.
