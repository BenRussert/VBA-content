# Tag Members (Publisher)
Represents a tag or a custom property that you can create for a shape, shape range, page, or publication. Each  **Tag** object contains the name of a custom property and a value for that property. **Tag** objects are members of the **[Tags](tags-object-publisher.md)** collection. Create a tag when you want to be able to selectively work with specific members of a collection, based on an attribute that isn't already represented by a built-in property.

## Methods



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| [Delete](tag.delete-method-publisher.md)|Deletes the specified object.|

## Properties
