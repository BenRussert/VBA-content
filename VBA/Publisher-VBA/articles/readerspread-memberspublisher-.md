# ReaderSpread Members (Publisher)
Represents the reader spread (not the printer spread) for the page. A reader spread generally contains one or two pages. The  **ReaderSpread** object properties provide information about whether pages are facing and how those pages are laid out. For example, in facing page view, pages two and three can be side-by-side or one on top of the other.
