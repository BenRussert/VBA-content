# Shape Members (Publisher)
Represents an object in the drawing layer, such as an AutoShape, freeform, OLE object, ActiveX control, or picture. The  **Shape** object is a member of the **[Shapes](shapes-object-publisher.md)** collection, which includes all the shapes on a page or in a selection.

## Methods

| [Delete](shape-delete-method-publisher.md)|Deletes the specified object.|
| [Duplicate](shape-duplicate-method-publisher.md)|Creates a duplicate of the specified  **[Shape](shape-object-publisher.md)** or **[ShapeRange](shaperange-object-publisher.md)** object, adds the new shape or range of shapes to the **Shapes** collection immediately after the shape or range of shapes specified originally, and then returns the new **Shape** or **ShapeRange** object.|
| [Flip](shape-flip-method-publisher.md)|Flips the specified shape around its horizontal or vertical axis, or flips all the shapes in the specified shape range around their horizontal or vertical axes.|
