| [Application](inlineshapes.application-property-publisher.md)|Used without an object qualifier, this property returns an  **[Application](application-object-publisher.md)** object that represents the current instance of Publisher. Used with an object qualifier, this property returns an  **Application** object that represents the creator of the specified object. When used with an OLE Automation object, it returns the object's application.|

| [Parent](inlineshapes.parent-property-publisher.md)|Returns an object that represents the parent object of the specified object. For example, for a  **[TextFrame](textframe-object-publisher.md)** object, returns a **[Shape](shape-object-publisher.md)** object representing the parent shape of the text frame. Read-only.|
| [Range](inlineshapes.range-property-publisher.md)|Returns a  **[ShapeRange](shaperange-object-publisher.md)** collection that represents the same set of inline shapes as the **InlineShapes** collection whose method was called. This allows for miscellaneous formatting of the contained shapes. Read-only.|
