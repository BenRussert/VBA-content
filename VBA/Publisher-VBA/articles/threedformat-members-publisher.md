# ThreeDFormat Members (Publisher)
Represents a shape's three-dimensional formatting.

## Methods



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| [IncrementRotationX](threedformat-incrementrotationx-method-publisher.md)|Changes the rotation of the specified shape around the x-axis (horizontal) by the specified number of degrees.|
| [IncrementRotationY](threedformat-incrementrotationy-method-publisher.md)|Changes the rotation of the specified shape around the y-axis (vertical) by the specified number of degrees.|
| [ResetRotation](threedformat-resetrotation-method-publisher.md)|Resets the extrusion rotation around the x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical) to 0 (zero) so that the front of the extrusion faces forward.|
| [SetExtrusionDirection](threedformat-setextrusiondirection-method-publisher.md)|Sets the direction that the extrusion's sweep path takes away from the extruded shape.|
| [SetThreeDFormat](threedformat-setthreedformat-method-publisher.md)|Sets the preset extrusion format. Each preset extrusion format contains a set of preset values for the 3-D properties of the extrusion.|

## Properties



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| [Application](threedformat-application-property-publisher.md)|Used without an object qualifier, this property returns an  **[Application](application-object-publisher.md)** object that represents the current instance of Publisher. Used with an object qualifier, this property returns an  **Application** object that represents the creator of the specified object. When used with an OLE Automation object, it returns the object's application.|
| [BevelBottomDepth](threedformat-bevelbottomdepth-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the depth of the bottom bevel. Read/write.|
| [BevelBottomInset](threedformat-bevelbottominset-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the inset size for the bottom bevel. Read/write.|
| [BevelBottomType](threedformat-bevelbottomtype-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets an  **MsoPresetCamera** constant that represents the bevel type for the bottom bevel. Read/write.|
| [BevelTopDepth](threedformat-beveltopdepth-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the depth of the top bevel. Read/write.|
| [BevelTopInset](threedformat-beveltopinset-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the depth of the top bevel. Read/write.|
| [BevelTopType](threedformat-beveltoptype-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets an  **MsoPresetCamera** constant that represents the bevel type for the top bevel. Read/write.|
| [ContourColor](threedformat-contourcolor-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **ColorFormat** object that represents color of the contour of a shape. Read/write.|
| [ContourWidth](threedformat-contourwidth-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the width of the contour of a shape. Read/write.|
| [Depth](threedformat-depth-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Variant** indicating the depth of the shape's extrusion. Read/write.|
| [ExtrusionColor](threedformat-extrusioncolor-property-publisher.md)|Returns a  **[ColorFormat](colorformat-object-publisher.md)** object representing the color of the shape's extrusion.|
| [ExtrusionColorType](threedformat-extrusioncolortype-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets an  **MsoExtrusionColorType** constant indicating whether the extrusion color is based on the extruded shape's fill (the front face of the extrusion) and automatically changes when the shape's fill changes, or whether the extrusion color is independent of the shape's fill. Read/write.|
| [FieldOfView](threedformat-fieldofview-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the amount of perspective for a shape. Read/write.|
| [Parent](threedformat-parent-property-publisher.md)|Returns an object that represents the parent object of the specified object. For example, for a  **[TextFrame](textframe-object-publisher.md)** object, returns a **[Shape](shape-object-publisher.md)** object representing the parent shape of the text frame. Read-only.|
| [Perspective](threedformat-perspective-property-publisher.md)| **msoTrue** if the extrusion appears in perspective — that is, if the walls of the extrusion narrow toward a vanishing point. **msoFalse** if the extrusion is a parallel, or orthographic, projection — that is, if the walls don't narrow toward a vanishing point. Read/write.|
| [PresetExtrusionDirection](threedformat-presetextrusiondirection-property-publisher.md)|Returns an  **MsoPresetExtrusionDirection** constant that represents the direction taken by the extrusion's sweep path leading away from the extruded shape (the front face of the extrusion). Read-only.|
| [PresetLightingDirection](threedformat-presetlightingdirection-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets an  **MsoPresetLightingDirection** constant that represents the position of the light source relative to the extrusion. Read/write.|
| [PresetLightingSoftness](threedformat-presetlightingsoftness-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets a  **MsoPresetLightingSoftness** constant that represents the intensity of the extrusion lighting. Read/write.|
| [PresetMaterial](threedformat-presetmaterial-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets an  **MsoPresetMaterial** constant that represents the extrusion surface material. Read/write.|
| [PresetThreeDFormat](threedformat-presetthreedformat-property-publisher.md)|Returns an  **MsoPresetThreeDFormat** constant that represents the preset extrusion format. Read-only.|
| [RotationX](threedformat-rotationx-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis in degrees. Can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates upward rotation; a negative value indicates downward rotation. Read/write  **Single**.|
| [RotationY](threedformat-rotationy-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, in degrees. Can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates rotation to the left; a negative value indicates rotation to the right. Read/write  **Single**.|
| [Visible](threedformat-visible-property-publisher.md)|Returns or sets an  **MsoTriState** constant indicating whether the specified object or the formatting applied to the specified object is visible. Read/write.|
