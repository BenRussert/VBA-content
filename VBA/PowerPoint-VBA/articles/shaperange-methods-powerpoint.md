# ShapeRange Methods (PowerPoint)

## Methods



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Align](shaperange-align-method-powerpoint.md)|Aligns the shapes in the specified range of shapes.|
|[Apply](shaperange-apply-method-powerpoint.md)|Applies to the specified shape range formatting that's been copied by using the  **PickUp** method.|
|[ApplyAnimation](shaperange-applyanimation-method-powerpoint.md)|Applies animation to a  **ShapeRange** object.|
|[ConvertTextToSmartArt](shaperange-converttexttosmartart-method-powerpoint.md)|Returns the number of objects in the specified collection. Read-only.|
|[Copy](shaperange-copy-method-powerpoint.md)|Copies the specified object to the Clipboard.|
|[Cut](shaperange-cut-method-powerpoint.md)|Deletes the specified object and places it on the Clipboard.|
|[Delete](shaperange-delete-method-powerpoint.md)|Deletes the specified  **ShapeRange** object.|
|[Distribute](shaperange-distribute-method-powerpoint.md)|Evenly distributes the shapes in the specified range of shapes. You can specify whether you want to distribute the shapes horizontally or vertically and whether you want to distribute them over the entire slide or just over the space they originally occupy.|
|[Duplicate](shaperange-duplicate-method-powerpoint.md)|Creates a duplicate of the specified  **ShapeRange** object, adds the range of shapes to the **Shapes** collection, and then returns the new **ShapeRange** object. The duplicated objects are placed at the end of the **Shapes** collection.|
|[Flip](shaperange-flip-method-powerpoint.md)|Flips the specified shape range around its horizontal or vertical axis.|
|[Group](shaperange-group-method-powerpoint.md)|Groups the shapes in the specified range. Returns the grouped shapes as a single  **[Shape](shape-object-powerpoint.md)** object.|
|[IncrementLeft](shaperange-incrementleft-method-powerpoint.md)|Moves the specified shape range horizontally by the specified number of points.|
|[IncrementRotation](shaperange-incrementrotation-method-powerpoint.md)|Changes the rotation of the specified shape range around the z-axis by the specified number of degrees. Use the  **Rotation** property to set the absolute rotation of the shape range.|
|[IncrementTop](shaperange-incrementtop-method-powerpoint.md)|Moves the specified shape range vertically by the specified number of points.|
|[Item](shaperange-item-method-powerpoint.md)|Returns a single  **Shape** object from the specified **ShapeRange** collection.|
|[MergeShapes](shaperange-mergeshapes-method-powerpoint.md)|Combines all of the shapes in the range to create a single new shape.|
|[PickUp](shaperange-pickup-method-powerpoint.md)|Copies the formatting of the specified shape. Use the  **Apply** method to apply the copied formatting to another shape.|
|[PickupAnimation](shaperange-pickupanimation-method-powerpoint.md)|Picks up all animation from the  **ShapeRange** object.|
|[Regroup](shaperange-regroup-method-powerpoint.md)|Regroups the group that the specified shape range belonged to previously. Returns the regrouped shapes as a single  **Shape** object.|
|[RerouteConnections](shaperange-rerouteconnections-method-powerpoint.md)|Reroutes connectors so that they take the shortest possible path between the shapes they connect. To do this, the  **RerouteConnections** method may detach the ends of a connector and reattach them to different connecting sites on the connected shapes.|
|[ScaleHeight](shaperange-scaleheight-method-powerpoint.md)|Scales the height of the shapes in the range by a specified factor. |
|[ScaleWidth](shaperange-scalewidth-method-powerpoint.md)|Scales the width of the shapes in the range by a specified factor. |
|[Select](shaperange-select-method-powerpoint.md)|Selects the specified object.|
|[SetShapesDefaultProperties](shaperange-setshapesdefaultproperties-method-powerpoint.md)|Applies the formatting for the specified shape to the default shape. Shapes created after this method has been used will have this formatting applied to them by default.|
|[Ungroup](shaperange-ungroup-method-powerpoint.md)|Ungroups any grouped shapes in the specified shape or range of shapes. Disassembles pictures and OLE objects within the specified shape or range of shapes. Returns the ungrouped shapes as a single  **[ShapeRange](shaperange-object-powerpoint.md)** object.|
|[UpgradeMedia](shaperange-upgrademedia-method-powerpoint.md)|Upgrades media within the specified  **ShapeRange** object.|
|[ZOrder](shaperange-zorder-method-powerpoint.md)|Moves the specified shape range in front of or behind other shapes in the collection (that is, changes the shape range's position in the z-order).|
