# Timing Members (PowerPoint)
Represents timing properties for an animation effect.

Represents timing properties for an animation effect.


## Properties



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Accelerate](timing-accelerate-property-powerpoint.md)|Returns or sets the percentage of the duration over which a timing acceleration should take place. Read/write.|
|[Application](timing-application-property-powerpoint.md)|Returns an  **[Application](application-object-powerpoint.md)** object that represents the creator of the specified object.|
|[AutoReverse](timing-autoreverse-property-powerpoint.md)|Determines whether an effect should play forward and then in reverse, thereby doubling its duration. Read/write.|
|[BounceEnd](timing-bounceend-property-powerpoint.md)|Read/write|
|[BounceEndIntensity](timing-bounceendintensity-property-powerpoint.md)|Read/write|
|[Decelerate](timing-decelerate-property-powerpoint.md)|Sets or returns the percentageof the duration over which a timing deceleration should take place. Read/write.|
|[Duration](timing-duration-property-powerpoint.md)|Returns or sets the length of an animation in seconds. Read/write.|
|[Parent](timing-parent-property-powerpoint.md)|Returns the parent object for the specified object.|
|[RepeatCount](timing-repeatcount-property-powerpoint.md)|Sets or returns the number of times to repeat an animation. Read/write.|
|[RepeatDuration](timing-repeatduration-property-powerpoint.md)|Sets or returns how long repeated animations should last, in seconds. Read/write.|
|[Restart](timing-restart-property-powerpoint.md)|Represents whether the animation effect restarts after the effect has started once. Read/write.|
|[RewindAtEnd](timing-rewindatend-property-powerpoint.md)|Represents whether an object returns to its beginning position after an animation has ended. Read/write.|
|[SmoothEnd](timing-smoothend-property-powerpoint.md)|Determines whether an animation should decelerate as it ends. Read/write.|
|[SmoothStart](timing-smoothstart-property-powerpoint.md)|Determines whether an animation should accelerate when it starts. Read/write.|
|[Speed](timing-speed-property-powerpoint.md)|Returns or sets the speed, in seconds, of the specified animation. Read/write.|
|[TriggerBookmark](timing-triggerbookmark-property-powerpoint.md)|Read/write|
|[TriggerDelayTime](timing-triggerdelaytime-property-powerpoint.md)|Sets or returns the delay, in seconds, from when an animation trigger is enabled. Read/write.|
|[TriggerShape](timing-triggershape-property-powerpoint.md)|Sets or returns a  **Shape** object that represents the shape associated with an animation trigger. Read/write.|
|[TriggerType](timing-triggertype-property-powerpoint.md)|Represents the trigger that starts an animation. Read/write.|
