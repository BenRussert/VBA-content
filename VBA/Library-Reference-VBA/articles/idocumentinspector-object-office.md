# IDocumentInspector Object (Office)

Represents the interface through which the methods of a  **IDocumentInspector** object are accessed.


## Remarks

 **IDocumentInspector** provides access to the **GetInfo**, **Inspect**, and **Fix** methods. The **IDocumentInspector** object is used with custom Document Inspector modules. This is in contrast to modules that are shipped with Microsoft Office.


 **Note**  The  **IDocumentInspector** object is for the exclusive use of custom Document Inspector module authors and cannot be used with Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
