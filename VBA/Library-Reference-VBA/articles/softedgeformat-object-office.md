# SoftEdgeFormat Object (Office)

Represents the soft edges effect in Office graphics.


## Remarks

The Soft Edge effect creates a mask around the edge of an object and blends the object with the transparent edge. The result is a faded or "feathered"edge.


## Example

This example sets the soft edge formatting for the text for the second shape on the second slide in a PowerPoint presentation:


```vb
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(2) 
 With .Text.Font 
 .Size = 32 
 .Name = "Palatino" 
 .Softedgeformat = msosoftedge6 
 End With 
End With 

```
