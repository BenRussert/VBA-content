# SharedWorkspaceFolders Object (Office)

A collection of the  **SharedWorkspaceFolder** objects in the current shared workspace.


 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Example

Use the  **Folders** property of the **SharedWorkspace** object to return a **SharedWorkspaceFolders** collection.


```vb
    Dim swsFolders As Office.SharedWorkspaceFolders 
    Set swsFolders = ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Folders 
    MsgBox "There are " &; swsFolders.Count &; _ 
        " folder(s) in the current shared workspace.", _ 
        vbInformation + vbOKOnly, _ 
        "Collection Information" 
    Set swsFolders = Nothing 

```
