# SharedWorkspaceLinks Object (Office)

A collection of the  **[SharedWorkspaceLink](sharedworkspacelink-object-office.md)** objects in the current shared workspace.


 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Example

Use the  **[Links](sharedworkspace-links-property-office.md)** property of the **[SharedWorkspace](sharedworkspace-object-office.md)** object to return a **SharedWorkspaceLinks** collection.


```vb
    Dim swsLinks As Office.SharedWorkspaceLinks 
    Set swsLinks = ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Links 
    MsgBox "There are " &; swsLinks.Count &; _ 
        " link(s) in the current shared workspace.", _ 
        vbInformation + vbOKOnly, _ 
        "Collection Information" 
    Set swsLinks = Nothing 

```
