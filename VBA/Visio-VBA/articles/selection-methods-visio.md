# Selection Methods (Visio)

## Methods



|**Name**|**Description**|

|[AddToContainers](selection-addtocontainers-method-visio.md)|Adds the selection of shapes to all underlying containers that allow it as a member.|
|[AddToGroup](selection-addtogroup-method-visio.md)|Adds the selected shapes to the selected group.|
|[Align](selection-align-method-visio.md)|Aligns two or more selected shapes.|
|[AutomaticLink](selection-automaticlink-method-visio.md)|Links selected shapes to data rows in the specified data recordset automatically, without requiring you to specify the exact correspondence of all shapes and data rows. Returns the number of shapes linked.|
|[AvoidPageBreaks](selection-avoidpagebreaks-method-visio.md)|Makes small adjustments to selected shapes to move them off page breaks.|
|[BoundingBox](selection-boundingbox-method-visio.md)|Returns a rectangle that tightly encloses the shapes of a selection.|
|[BreakLinkToData](selection-breaklinktodata-method-visio.md)|Breaks links between all shapes in the selection and data rows in the specified data recordset.|
|[BringForward](selection-bringforward-method-visio.md)|Brings the shape or selected shapes forward one position in the z-order.|
|[BringToFront](selection-bringtofront-method-visio.md)|Brings the shape or selected shapes to the front of the z-order.|
|[Combine](selection-combine-method-visio.md)|Creates a new shape by combining selected shapes.|
|[ConnectShapes](selection-connectshapes-method-visio.md)|Connects two or more selected shapes with a dynamic connector. Returns **Nothing** .|
|[ConvertToGroup](selection-converttogroup-method-visio.md)|Converts a selection or an object from another application (a linked or embedded object) to a group.|
|[Copy](selection-copy-method-visio.md)|Copies a selection to the Clipboard.|
|[Cut](selection-cut-method-visio.md)|Deletes a selection and places it on the Clipboard.|
|[Delete](selection-delete-method-visio.md)|Deletes an object or selection.|
|[DeleteEx](selection-deleteex-method-visio.md)|Deletes additional shapes associated with the selection, such as connectors and unselected container members, when the selection is deleted.|
|[DeselectAll](selection-deselectall-method-visio.md)|Deselects all shapes in a window or selection.|
|[Distribute](selection-distribute-method-visio.md)|Distributes three or more selected shapes at regular intervals on the drawing page. The order of selection is irrelevant.|
|[DrawRegion](selection-drawregion-method-visio.md)|Draws a new shape that represents the region containing a given point.|
|[Duplicate](selection-duplicate-method-visio.md)|Duplicates a selection.|
|[Export](selection-export-method-visio.md)|Exports an object from Microsoft Visio to a file format such as .bmp, .dib, .dwg, .dxf, .emf, .emz, .gif, .htm, .jpg, .png, .svg, .svgz, .tif, or .wmf.|
|[FitCurve](selection-fitcurve-method-visio.md)|Reduces the number of geometry segments in a shape or shapes by replacing them with similar spline, arc, and line segments that approximate the paths of the initial segments. Typically, this reduces the number of segments in the shape.|
|[Flip](selection-flip-method-visio.md)|Flips selected shapes either as a group or individually about their pins. Returns  **Nothing** .|
|[FlipHorizontal](selection-fliphorizontal-method-visio.md)|Flips an object horizontally.|
|[FlipVertical](selection-flipvertical-method-visio.md)|Flips an object vertically.|

|[GetCallouts](selection-getcallouts-method-visio.md)|Returns the list of identifiers of the callout shapes in the selection.|
|[GetContainers](selection-getcontainers-method-visio.md)|Returns an array of shape identifiers (IDs) of the container shapes in the selection.|
|[GetIDs](selection-getids-method-visio.md)|Gets the shape IDs of the shapes in the selection.|
|[Group](selection-group-method-visio.md)|Groups the objects that are selected in a selection, or it converts a shape into a group.|
|[Intersect](selection-intersect-method-visio.md)|Creates one closed shape from the area in which selected shapes overlap or intersect.|
|[Join](selection-join-method-visio.md)|Creates a new shape by joining selected shapes.|
|[Layout](selection-layout-method-visio.md)|Lays out the shapes and/or reroutes the connectors for the page, master, group, or selection.|
|[LayoutChangeDirection](selection-layoutchangedirection-method-visio.md)|Revises the layout of a selection of connected shapes by rotating or flipping the connected shapes as a unit, without rotating or flipping the individual shapes.|
|[LayoutIncremental](selection-layoutincremental-method-visio.md)|Makes small adjustments to the position of shapes in the selection to better align the shapes or to space them evenly from other shapes.|
|[LinkToData](selection-linktodata-method-visio.md)|Links a selection of shapes to a single data row in a data recordset.|
|[MemberOfContainersIntersection](selection-memberofcontainersintersection-method-visio.md)|Returns an array of identifiers of the shapes that belong to the normal or list containers that contain all the shapes in the selection.|
|[MemberOfContainersUnion](selection-memberofcontainersunion-method-visio.md)|Returns an array of identifiers of the shapes that belong to the normal or list containers that contain at least one of the shapes in the selection.|
|[Move](selection-move-method-visio.md)|Moves a selection a specified distance.|
|[MoveToSubprocess](selection-movetosubprocess-method-visio.md)|Moves the selection to the specified page, and drops a replacement shape on the source page and links it to the target page. Returns the selection of moved shapes on the target page.|
